# FantasyOscars

This Node.js Express server was built in half of a week to allow my friends and I to compare and score our Oscar Predictions.

Due to the time limitation of this project's development, a number of best practices were avoided (eg the generation of an HTML table with String manipulation rather than a templater such as Jade), but I still decided to password protect individual responses to keep my friends from changing my answers.
